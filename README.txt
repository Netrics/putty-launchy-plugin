UPDATES
The latest version of this software can always be found at:
http://putty-launchy-plugin.googlecode.com/


INSTALLATION
Copy PuTTY.dll to your Launchy Plugins folder (most likely 'C:\Program
Files\Launchy\Plugins') and restart Launchy. If PuTTY.exe is not in your PATH,
go to the options dialog and set the path to PuTTY there.


USAGE
To begin completion, type "ssh" or "putty" followed by tab or space. The plugin
will list all of your PuTTY sessions and search for them by keyword (not by
straight text). Therefore the session "home linux ssh" can be found by any
permutation of "home," "linux," and "ssh."


CHANGELOG
v1.2:
    Removed dependency on VC++ Runtime and .NET CLR
    Unsupported plugin for x64 systems

v1.1:
    Added options dialog to set PATH to PuTTY.
    Added icon.
v1.0:
    Initial Release
